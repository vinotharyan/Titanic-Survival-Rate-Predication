# Titanic-Survival-Rate-Predication 

The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.

The Objective of this notebook is to give an idea how is the workflow in any predictive modeling problem. How do we check features, how do we add new features and some Machine Learning Concepts. I have tried to keep the notebook as basic as possible so that even newbies can understand every phase of it.

This is binary classification problem this repositor which contains the best eda for titanic dataset and all important function carry out to bulid a model 

got a accuracy of 90% and Got 110th Rank among 10900 comptitors which in Top 2% in Kaggle compititon.
